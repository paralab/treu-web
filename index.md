## What is TREU ?

Trust and Reproducibility Education for Undergraduates (**TREU**) engages students in research practices that emphasize trust and reproducibility
in the [OAC](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC) priority areas of High-performance Computing (HPC), Machine Learning (ML), and Computer Networking.
A typical undergraduate is not sufficiently exposed to these
concerns nor the aforesaid supportive toolsâ€”and yet they will be the ones building future intelligent systems in about a decade.
Our REU site will help broaden the conception of computing as
a field, improve
their technical skills, strengthen their understanding of ethical concerns in computing, and nurture their
abilities to foster inclusivity in computing.
TREU combines training activities
(in technical skills, ethics and
inclusion, and research),
mentored research projects, and cohort-building.

The program focuses on teaching students about the nature of research through structured activities and legitimate peripheral participation, **rather than limiting their involvement to just tasks they can perform independently**. Across the cohort, students will be embedded in research from different areas related to trust and reproducibility, most likely topics that they didn't realize were even part of computing.  Our approach will accelerate students' engagement with the purpose, impact, and practices of research. 

Housing, travel, and a $XXXX stipend are provided for participants.
