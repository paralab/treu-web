## REU Site: Trust and Reproducibility of Intelligent Computation

**Applications are now welcome** from undergraduate students at all levels (US Citizens, Permanent Residents) to be selected for a 10-week NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates Traineeship held from June 1st till August 10th, 2023. The traineeship will be offered at the campus of the University of Utah, in the Kahlert School of Computing, located near the majestic Wasatch Mountain ranges.  The application deadline is April 15, 2023, and *we expect to fund only about 10 REUs*.

We will introduce our trainees to the basics of many exciting and crucially important computer science research areas, demonstrating through actual examples how trust and reproducibility are enhanced, and how correctness verification is performed to eliminate software defects. For example:

- We will introduce the basics of High-performance Computing (HPC), including how numerical algorithms are specified conveniently using Jupyter notebooks and submitted for execution on supercomputers.

- We will introduce our trainees to the process of classifying images using machine learning (ML). The trainees will use state-of-the-art ML training systems that are driven by Jupyter notebook-based scripts in order to achieve acceptable levels of classification accuracy.

- We will demonstrate advanced wireless networking in the context of Utah's POWDER project. In particular, they will learn how software-defined radios work and how transmissions from on campus buses can be monitored.

- In the context of all these projects, we will point out how trust, reproducibility and verifiability are enhanced.

In a broader sense, HPC is fundamental to grand-challenge issues ranging from Climate Research to Fighting Pandemics. ML plays a pivotal role in our day-to-day lives including in Medical Diagnosis from MRI Images all the way to Self-Driving Cars. ML also reduces or eliminates hours of HPC simulations by taking decisions based on data rather than laborious computations. Computer Networking is fundamental to the connected society. It also enables **smart devices** that will be in our pockets or in our cars to ``talk to each other.'' We will introduce the trainees to methods that enhance the security and integrity of the communicated data.

We will *fly out* our REU trainees to Utah, *house them* in our wonderful on-campus housing, *pay all room and board*, and on top of it, *pay a stipend of $7,200* per student. The training imparted will cover *not only* in the aforesaid technical priority areas *but also* many ancillary areas including ethics, inclusivity, and microaggression management. There will be plenty of hands-on research projects, cohort-building activities, and (last but not least) *fun social activities*.

Activities in this REU site are sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure ([OAC](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC)) whose mission is to train tomorrow's workforce in areas such as covered by this REU site.

## **How can I apply?**

While the program is open to all, students with any of the following traits is especially encouraged to apply:

 - Underrepresented in Computer Science Research i.e. Gender minorities, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities;
 
 - Sophomore or Junior undergraduate majoring in Mathematics or Computer Science
 
 - Interest in a PhD in Computer Science

## **Questions?**

For additional questions, please email reu-site-utah-ksoc@googlegroups.com (kindly do not send-in any personal information other than through the above site, and unless requested). There are also instructions provided at our *REU Site: Trust and Reproducibility of Intelligent Computation* listed within the [**NSF ETAP Portal**](https://etap.nsf.gov/award/1125/opportunity/1354).
