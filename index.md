## Trust and Reproducibility of Intelligent Computation

This 10-week Research Experience for Undergraduates summer internship sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) will be held at the Kahlert School of Computing, University of Utah, from June 1st till August 10th, 2023, in the beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah -- nestled amidst the Wasatch Mountains depicted by our cartoon logo here. We call this REU site ''TREU'' because of its emphasis on *Trust* (*How do we rely on the computed results?*) and *Reproducibility* (''Can others replicate either the experimental outcomes of an HPC simulation or an ML classification activity?'').

It will train students in the exciting computer science research areas of High-performance Computing (HPC), Machine Learning (ML), and Computer Networking. HPC is fundamental to grand-challenge issues ranging from Climate Research to Fighting Pandemics. ML plays a pivotal role in our day-to-day lives including in applications such as ChatBOTs to assist-devices for the vision-impaired. ML also reduces or eliminates hours of HPC simulations by taking decisions based on data rather than first-principle computations.



hTrust and Reproducibility of Intelligent Computation engages students in research practices that emphasize trust and reproducibility in the National Science Foundation's [OAC](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC) priority areas of 
Our REU Site combines training activities
(in technical skills, ethics and
inclusion, and research),
mentored research projects, and cohort-building.

The program focuses on teaching students about the nature of research through structured activities and legitimate peripheral participation, **rather than limiting their involvement to just tasks they can perform independently**. Across the cohort, students will be embedded in research from different areas related to trust and reproducibility, most likely topics that they didn't realize were even part of computing.  Our approach will accelerate students' engagement with the purpose, impact, and practices of research. 

Housing, travel, and a $XXXX stipend are provided for participants. 

## Should I apply to Treu ? 

We have two goals for selecting students for this program 
 
 1. to provide research experience to broaden participation in computing to populations that are historically underrepresented in computing, including women, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities; and, 
 2. to reach students whose research opportunities are severely limited at their home institution. We plan to recruit 30-50% of our students from these groups. 

While the program is open to all, students with any of the following traits is especially encouraged to [apply](./apply.html):
 - Underrepresented in Computer Science Research i.e. Gender minorities, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities;
 - Sophomore or Junior undergraduate majoring in Mathematics or Computer Science
 - Interest in a PhD in Computer Science

## When will this take place ?

TREU takes place over 10 weeks in the summer, exact timing subject to on-campus housing availability. Start date is approximately June 1st, end date is approximately August 10th.
