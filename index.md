## What is TREU ?

Trust and Reproducibility Education for Undergraduates (**TREU**) engages students in research practices that emphasize trust and reproducibility
in the [OAC](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC) priority areas of High-performance Computing (HPC), Machine Learning (ML), and Computer Networking.
A typical undergraduate is not sufficiently exposed to these
concerns nor the aforesaid supportive tools—and yet they will be the ones building future intelligent systems in about a decade.
Our REU site will help broaden the conception of computing as
a field, improve
their technical skills, strengthen their understanding of ethical concerns in computing, and nurture their
abilities to foster inclusivity in computing.
TREU combines training activities
(in technical skills, ethics and
inclusion, and research),
mentored research projects, and cohort-building.
