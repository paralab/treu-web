## REU Site: Trust and Reproducibility of Intelligent Computation

**Applications are now open** from undergraduate students (US Citizens, Permanent Residents) at all levels to be selected to this *10-week Research Experience for Undergraduates summer internship* sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) will be held at the Kahlert School of Computing, University of Utah, from June 1st till August 10th, 2023, in the beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah -- nestled amidst the Wasatch Mountains.

We call this REU site ''TREU'' because of its emphasis on *Trust* (*How do we rely on the computed results?*) and *Reproducibility* (*Can others replicate either the experimental outcomes of an HPC simulation or an ML classification activity?*).

We will introduce our trainees to the basics of many exciting and crucially important computer science research areas, demonstrating through actual examples how trust and reproducibility are enhanced, and how correctness verification is performed to eliminate software defects. For example:

- We will introduce the basics of  High-performance Computing (HPC), including how numerical algorithms are specified conveniently using Jupyter notebooks and submitted to a supercomputer.

- We will introduce trainees to the process by which Chest X-Rays are classified by machine learning (ML) systems. They will be able to practice these skills using ML training systems that are driven by Jupyter notebook-based scripts.

- We will demonstrate advanced wireless networking in the context of Utah's POWDER project. In particular, the strength of signals coming from wireless transmitters mounted on campus buses will be monitored.

- In the context of all these projects, we will point out how trust, reproducibility and verifiability are enhanced.

In a broader sense, HPC is fundamental to grand-challenge issues ranging from Climate Research to Fighting Pandemics. ML plays a pivotal role in our day-to-day lives including in applications such as Medical Diagnosis from MRI Images to Self-Driving Cars. ML also reduces or eliminates hours of HPC simulations by taking decisions based on data rather than first-principle computations. Computer Networking is fundamental to the connected society as well as the **smart devices** that will be in our pockets or in our cars, and ``talk to each other,'' with us ensuring the security and integrity of the communicated data.

Sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure ([OAC](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC)), we will *fly out* the selected REU trainees to Utah, *house them* in our wonderful on-campus housing, *pay all room and board*, and on top of it, *pay a stipend of $7,200* per student for giving us their time and attention to be trained *not only* in the aforesaid technical priority areas *but also* the connected and important *societal skills* that include ethics, inclusivity, and microaggression management. There will be plenty of hands-on research projects, cohort-building activities, and (last but not least) *fun social activities*.

## **How can I apply?**

While the program is open to all, students with any of the following traits is especially encouraged to apply via the [**this NSF ETAP Portal**](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC). Note that the **Application Deadline** is April 15, 2023, and that *we expect to fund only about 10 REUs*.

We **especially** encourage applications from

 - Underrepresented in Computer Science Research i.e. Gender minorities, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities;
 
 - Sophomore or Junior undergraduate majoring in Mathematics or Computer Science
 
 - Interest in a PhD in Computer Science
