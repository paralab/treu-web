## What is TREU ?

Trust and Reproducibility Education for Undergraduates (**TREU**) engages students in research practices that emphasize trust and reproducibility
in the [OAC](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC) priority areas of High-performance Computing (HPC), Machine Learning (ML), and Computer Networking.
A typical undergraduate is not sufficiently exposed to these
concerns nor the aforesaid supportive toolsâ€”and yet they will be the ones building future intelligent systems in about a decade.
Our REU site will help broaden the conception of computing as
a field, improve
their technical skills, strengthen their understanding of ethical concerns in computing, and nurture their
abilities to foster inclusivity in computing.
TREU combines training activities
(in technical skills, ethics and
inclusion, and research),
mentored research projects, and cohort-building.

The program focuses on teaching students about the nature of research through structured activities and legitimate peripheral participation, **rather than limiting their involvement to just tasks they can perform independently**. Across the cohort, students will be embedded in research from different areas related to trust and reproducibility, most likely topics that they didn't realize were even part of computing.  Our approach will accelerate students' engagement with the purpose, impact, and practices of research. 

Housing, travel, and a $XXXX stipend are provided for participants. 

## Should I apply to Treu ? 

We have two goals for selecting students for the REU 
Site: (1) to provide research experience to broaden participation in computing to populations that are historically underrepresented in computing, including women, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities; and, (2) to reach 
students whose research opportunities are 
severely limited at their home institution. We plan to recruit 30-50% of our students from these groups. 

While the program is open to all, students with any of the following traits is especially encouraged to apply:
 - Underrepresented in Computer Science Research i.e. Gender minorities, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities;
 - Sophomore or Junior undergraduate majoring in Mathematics or Computer Science
 - Interest in a PhD in Computer Science

## When will this take place ?

TREU takes place over 10 weeks in the summer, exact timing subject to on-campus housing availability. Start date is approximately June 1st, end date is approximately August 10th.
