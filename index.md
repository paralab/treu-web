## REU Site: Trust and Reproducibility of Intelligent Computation

**Applications are now open** from undergraduate students (US Citizens, Permanent Residents) at all levels to be selected to this *10-week Research Experience for Undergraduates summer internship* sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) will be held at the Kahlert School of Computing, University of Utah, from June 1st till August 10th, 2023, in the beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah -- nestled amidst the Wasatch Mountains.

We call this REU site ''TREU'' because of its emphasis on *Trust* (*How do we rely on the computed results?*) and *Reproducibility* (*Can others replicate either the experimental outcomes of an HPC simulation or an ML classification activity?*).

We will will train students in the exciting computer science research areas of High-performance Computing (HPC), Machine Learning (ML), and Computer Networking. HPC is fundamental to grand-challenge issues ranging from Climate Research to Fighting Pandemics. ML plays a pivotal role in our day-to-day lives including in applications such as ChatBOTs to assist-devices for the vision-impaired. ML also reduces or eliminates hours of HPC simulations by taking decisions based on data rather than first-principle computations. Computer Networking is fundamental to the connected society as well as the **smart devices** that will be in our pockets or in our cars, and ``talk to each other,'' with us ensuring the security and integrity of the communicated data.

Sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure ([OAC](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC), we will *fly out* the selected REU trainees to Utah, *house them* in our wonderful on-campus housing, *pay all room and board*, and on top of it, *pay a stipend of $7,200* per student for giving us their time and attention to be trained *not only* in the aforesaid technical priority areas *but also* the connected and important *societal skills* that include ethics, inclusivity, and microaggression management. There will be plenty of hands-on research projects, cohort-building activities, and (last but not least) *fun social activities*.

## **How can I apply?**

While the program is open to all, students with any of the following traits is especially encouraged to apply via the [**this NSF ETAP Portal**](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC).

We **especially** encourage applications from

 - Underrepresented in Computer Science Research i.e. Gender minorities, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities;
 
 - Sophomore or Junior undergraduate majoring in Mathematics or Computer Science
 
 - Interest in a PhD in Computer Science

## **Questions?**

Please ask your questions through our ETAP portal at [**this NSF ETAP Portal**](https://etap.nsf.gov/) by searching for **REU Site: Trust and Reproducibility of Intelligent Computation** and asking your questions there. Kindly do not send-in any personal information other than through the above site, and unless requested.
