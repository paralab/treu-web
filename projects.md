| Faculty | Research Areas | Project Description                |
|---------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| [Ganesh Gopalakrishnan][gg] | Formal methods, floating point arithmetic | **Precision Tuning versus Accuracy Improvement for GPUs:** This project will first research how best to exploit new number formats such as 16-bit floating-point arithmetic that reduce precision. It will then demonstrate methods to restore the safety of the computation through methods such as rescaling numbers to fit the representational precision allowed. These will be illustrated via pre-existing Pytorch libraries such as APEX that support mixed-precision neural network training. |
| [Mary Hall][mh] | Compilers, Performance | **Sparse Tensor Code Synthesis with Automated Weight Reduction:** Tensors can be used to represent data sets such as  images. Such tensors can be sparsified, and the generated code can take advantage of this sparsity, helping reduce total computation and data movement.  This research will involve implementing functions to sparsify networks, considering implications on code synthesis, performance and accuracy. |
